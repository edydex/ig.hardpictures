Will make a walkthrough of how to make your own photoalbums page based on this template. 

To add more albums to your page just upload the folder into this directory and run addAlbums.py

To change the profile picture just replace profilePic.jpg with your own.
At some point I will add a script that customizes your page - changes your profile name, tab title, and your links.
The script will also allow you to choose if you want to keep the header "hard.pictures"
